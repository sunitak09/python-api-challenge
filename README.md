API Module 6: WeatherPy and VacationPy
The use of API make it very easy to obtain the data and information based on the coordinates defined in the code. 
THe random selection of cities in this homework and analyzing the weather data was fun part. With each iteration, number of cities, cities selection kept on changing and so was the defined variables data.
The statistical analysis based on single variable linear regression analysis was not able to relate with the independant variable. However, the difference between association of few weather data to the latitude in two hemisphere was impressive.
Similarly, use of APIs according to geographical coordinates can help in getting data in remote locations before planning any personal trip.
